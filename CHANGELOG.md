- After a while of leaving this repository unhandled I decieded to come  back and add what I've done so far. I have created both a player and enemies that the player can interact with but no musical adjustments yet. I have noticed that just making the basic of the game are time consuming but it's nothing to worry about. I should have all of the basic down by half way from now to turn in the IA. That being March 25. Also I have found that using inheritance is key in this project as seen with the class stats. The script predefines the stats that the player and enemies will be using until of course being changed by their individual calls. The most simple case of this being the enemies health and the hitbox damage. Where now one colliosn can look to other and vary it's damage which will be done for the musical ascpet were the damage chamges, depending when you hit an enemy. Also might consider adding my own musical variation and move to CHANGING the music as an enemy fights.
